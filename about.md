This blog documents the construction of a safe Rust API for the
[Teensy](https://pjrc.com/teensy/) boards. The goal is to help teach
you how to use existing C implementations and manufacturer's
documentation to build your own embedded applications.

The Teensy boards are readily available ARM Cortex-M development
boards. Their normal development environment is the Arduino IDE. We'll
be bypassing that entirely, going straight to the low-level hardware
registers.
